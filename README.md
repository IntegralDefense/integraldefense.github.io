#### Moving to a "Free First" approach for cybersecurity ###
Step 1: call salesperson, Step 2: get quotes, Step 3: compare functionality.

Remember the days when the strategy was to look for a commercial tool first? That strategy has led to quite a few purchases, some that we are now stuck with, some that we still get value from.

But, as I look at the opensource security system landscape, I'm thinking we need to move to a "Free First" mindset. Getting involved with opensource, seeing projects grow into extremely capable systems, and seeing how quickly they are becoming mainstreamâ€¦why not take a little time to research opensource before you buy? What's the downside? For good opensource projects the time investment is relatively small. Setup a proof of concept to understand the functionality and learn how it fits into your security program (without the marketing FUD). Worst case, you become more educated and better prepared for determining the value of the commerical tools.

Maybe you are looking to buy automation tools. Maybe you are thinking about a SIEM.  

Maybe you should go "Free First".

### Opensource is well positioned for security automation ###
Some interesting quotes about SOAR related to the opportunities, limitations for integrations, unrealized out-of-the-box value, and adoption predictions [here](https://blogs.gartner.com/anton-chuvakin/2018/02/22/our-security-orchestration-and-automation-soar-paper-publishes/)

SOAR is all about connecting systems into a cohesive process. Who is in the position to accomplish this the best? Every company has different systems they use and rely on. Who is best positioned to create the integrations & systems necessary to connect them?

I believe the teams that rely on those technologies and use them every day to accomplish a mission are in the best position to continually improve & maintain those technologies. Unfortunately, I don't believe a commercial solution is best suited to provide this. How many integrations can a commercial solution actually support, test, and maintain as systems change? How do they prioritize the integrations? How quickly can one company do this? Does it align with your needs? In my experience, this is a bottleneck to success. Conversely, this is the value of opensource; connecting not only disparate systems, but teams, your specific priorities, and processes into a cohesive solution.

We have a great foundation that supports a mature process. We've learned from and implemented systems based on both our every day experience, as well as collaboration with best in class companies. Take security collaboration to a new, meaningful level. Join us!

### The Why, and how it fits together ###
Our goal is not the creation of code, it is the streamlining of this process. With that said, to enable the capability & effectiveness of this process we have created and integrated systems. Creating smart systems to improve this process has been our key to success. 

All of the tools required to accomplish this process are now available from Integral Defense for free. Join us!

### integral systems for cyber defense ###

There are many good security tools across the computing landscape, from email, network, and endpoint, to log aggregation, machine learning, case management, vulnerability management, and many more. Connecting these systems together in an efficient and meaningful way is still a major challenge within a security ecosystem. This github site contains a variety of code, including productivity tools, integration scripts, sophisticated detection capabilities, alert management, and an analysis correlation engine (**ACE**).

Every company is different. The combination of technology stacks, attack surfaces, and threat actors are not consistent across companies. Much of the code within this repo can be easily enhanced to accommodate specific technologies and allow you to make strides towards lean, efficient processes for your security program...not to mention the killer out of the open-box capabilities!
