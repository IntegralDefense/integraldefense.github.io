### integral systems for cyber defense ###

There are many good security tools across the computing landscape, from email, network, and endpoint, to log aggregation, machine learning, case management, vulnerability management, and many more. Connecting these systems together in an efficient and meaningful way is still a major challenge within a security ecosystem. This github site contains a variety of code, including productivity tools, integration scripts, sophisticated detection capabilities, alert management, and an analysis correlation engine (**ACE**).

Every company is different. The combination of technology stacks, attack surfaces, and threat actors are not consistent across companies. Much of the code within this repo can be easily enhanced to accommodate specific technologies and allow you to make strides towards lean, efficient processes for your security program...not to mention the killer out of the open-box capabilities!
